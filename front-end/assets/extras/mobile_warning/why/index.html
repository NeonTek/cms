        Why Neonteks's CMS Flexbox Editor is Temporarily Unavailable on Mobile
        Devices
      </h1>

      <p>
        At Neontek, we pride ourselves on providing a seamless and user-friendly
        experience for everyone. However, you may have noticed that the CMS
        Flexbox is currently unavailable when accessed through a mobile phone.
        We want to take a moment to explain why this decision as made and what
        steps we are taking to resolve this issue.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the Issue</h2>
      <p>
        Our website is powered by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grapesjs.com">GrapesJS</a> to
        enable smooth editing and customisation of web pages. This system is
        integral to how we manage and provide value to the our users.
        <br />
        Unfortunately, we recently encountered a technical challenge with the
        drag-and-drop functionality in our CMS. Specifically, when accessed
        through a mobile device, this feature fails to perform as expected.
      </p>
      <h2>Why Disable Mobile Access</h2>
      <p>
        You might wonder why we decided to disable mobile access instead of
        leaving the site operational. Here's why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Experience Matters: </strong>A partially functional
          website can be frustrating, especially when users expect a polished
          experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintaining Professionalism: </strong>Rather than delivering a
          subpar or buggy experience, we believe its better to pause access
          until we can confidently restore full functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient Problem Solving: </strong>Limiting mobile access
          allows our team to focus on addressing the issue without worrying
          about interactions causing further complications.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What We're Doing to Fix It</h2>
      <p>
        Rest assured, this is only a temporary measure. Our development team is
        actively working to resolve the drag-and-drop issue and restore full
        mobile functionality. Here's what we're doing:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaborating with CMS Experts: </strong>
          We're in touch with the CMS developers to troubleshoot the problem at
          its root.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testing Solutions: </strong>
          Our team is running extensive tests on both desktop and mobile devices
          to ensure the fix works seamlessly across all platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exploring Alternatives: </strong>
          In case the current CMS limitations persist, we're researching
          alternative tools or plugins to enhance mobile compatibility.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Will Mobile Access Return?</h2>
      <p>
        We understand that this may inconvenience some users, and we sincerely
        apologize for any disruption caused. While we can't provide an exact
        timeline, we are prioritizing this fix and will update you as soon as
        the mobile experience is back to normal.
      </p>

      <h2>A Message to Our Users</h2>

        challenge. Our commitment to quality and user satisfaction drives every
        decision we make, and we're confident that the steps we're taking now
        will result in a better, more reliable experience for everyone in the
        long run. <br />
